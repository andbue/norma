    This normalizer works by storing a dictionary, or "mapping", of
    word forms in the form "input_word" -> "normalized_word", together
    with counts how often this correspondence was seen in the training
    data.

    For normalization, it returns the "normalized_word" which was seen
    most often with the corresponding "input_word".  The score
    reflects the count of this mapping proportional to the count of
    all mappings for "input_word".
